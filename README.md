(contrary to what the name suggests, this repo is me taking
a tour of C, not giving the tour). basic ideas reimplemented in C.

#### Quickstart
1. ```make ARGS="example.com http"```
2. follow the prompt demo included below

#### Demo
![demo](./docs/demo.gif)

#### Roadmap
- wizard for choosing which tests to run
- informative prompt messages for helping
  user provide input
- programmatic e2e for tests which involve
  servers and block program execution
- meticulous tests covering edge cases

#### Disclaimer
- llm gateway was used in the process of creating
  first drafts of certain excersises, i'll cite
  the relevant code once i've reached 100 or so
  excersises
- my compiler and os specific header files or
  other lower level aspects of execution env
  is not identical to every other machine
- run without gaurdrails/verification at
  your own peril, or vm before execution
